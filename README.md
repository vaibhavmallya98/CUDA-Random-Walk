# CUDA-Random-Walk

CUDA Random Walk - Implement a CUDA program to simulate a 2D random walk. You will simulate a large number of walkers taking steps either north, south, east, or west on a grid, and calculate the average distance they travel from the origin. Your code should implement 3 different functions that internally use different models namely cudaMalloc (normal CUDA malloc), cudaMallocHost (pinned CUDA malloc) and cuda MallocManaged (managed CUDA malloc). Report the time taken by each function for the calculation.
